# What is iPdfWriter?

**iPdfWriter** is a lightweight implementation that allows modifying a **pdf** document totally or partially by replacing tags.

The idea is to try to quickly and easily facilitate the task of filling in the 'typical' report file that the client wants to send by email with the data filled in from their erp, vertical application, custom development, etc... to which I am sure that you have faced each other at some point.

- Page 1

    Basic steps, for more details please see [sample01.cs] file.

    1. Load pdf file

            var doc = new PdfInput
            {
                AutoUpdateChanges = true,
                Input = "~/Resources/Sample-01/file-sample.pdf"
            };

    2. Replace **#TITLE#** tag with another text

            doc.Replace(new ReplaceText(
                new WithTextObject
                {
                    Text = "#TITLE#",
                    NewText = "Lorem ipsum",
                    UseTestMode = useTestMode,
                    TextOffset = PointF.Empty,
                    Style = TextStylesTable["ReportTitle"],
                    ReplaceOptions = ReplaceTextOptions.AccordingToMargins
                }));

    3. Replace **#BAR-CHART#** tag with an image

            using (var barGraph = PdfImage.FromFile("~/Resources/Sample-01/Images/bar-chart.png"))
            {
                doc.Replace(new ReplaceText(
                    new WithImageObject
                    {
                        Text = "#BAR-CHART#",
                        UseTestMode = useTestMode,
                        ImageOffset = PointF.Empty,
                        Style = ImagesStylesTable["Default"],
                        ReplaceOptions = ReplaceTextOptions.Default,
                        Image = barGraph
                    }));
            }

    4. Save pdf file result

            var saveResult = result.Result.Action(new SaveToFile { OutputPath = "~/Output/Sample01/Sample-01" });


    Below is an image showing the original pdf file and the result after applying the replacements described above
