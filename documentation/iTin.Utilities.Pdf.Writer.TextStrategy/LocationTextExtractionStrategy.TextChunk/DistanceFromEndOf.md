# LocationTextExtractionStrategy.TextChunk.DistanceFromEndOf method

Computes the distance between the end of 'other' and the beginning of this chunk in the direction of this chunk's orientation vector. Note that it's a bad idea to call this for chunks that aren't on the same line and orientation, but we don't explicitly check for that condition for performance reasons.

```csharp
public float DistanceFromEndOf(TextChunk other)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| other | The other chunk. |

## Return Value

The number of spaces between the end of 'other' and the beginning of this chunk.
